Freed from his captor, Viper spread his wings and went forth to explore the surface world. With Poison Attacks imbued with virulent liquid, causing joints to harden, crippling foes whether they choose to flee or fight. Nethertoxin spreads throughout their bodies, turning wounds into fatalities, and fatigue into death. The Netherdrake's tough, Corrosive Skin protects against spell-craft, and burns assailants with acid. But it is the dreaded Viper Strike that signals the beginning of the end. The afflicted victim staggers to a crawl, barely able to take its next step. If the Netherdrake doesn't finish his targets off, the venom in their veins will. ",

      "description": "As the embodiment of mischief, imagination, and change, Zoe acts as the cosmic messenger of Targon, heralding major events that reshape worlds. Her mere presence warps the arcane mathematics governing realities, sometimes causing cataclysms without conscious effort or malice. This perhaps explains the breezy nonchalance with which Zoe approaches her duties, giving her plenty of time to focus on playing games, tricking mortals, or otherwise amusing herself. An encounter with Zoe can be joyous and life affirming, but it is always more than it appears and often extremely dangerous.",

      "description": "Born in an ancient, sorcerous catastrophe, Zyra is the wrath of nature given form—an alluring hybrid of plant and human, kindling new life with every step. She views the many mortals of Valoran as little more than prey for her seeded progeny, and thinks nothing of slaying them with flurries of deadly spines. Though her true purpose has not been revealed, Zyra wanders the world, indulging her most primal urges to colonize, and strangle all other life from it.",
